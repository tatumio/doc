To ensure that the faucet service is not abused we have updated the [fund](docs/faucets/fund.md) function in the Faucets submodule to require a testnet key, which can be acquired for free in our [dashboard](https://dashboard.tatum.io).

```typescript
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumio/tatum'

// What changed
const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({
  network: Network.ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA,
  // Include this line to have api key.
  apiKey: { v4: 'YOUR-API-KEY'}
})
```
