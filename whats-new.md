### March 15 2024 - Fee Estimation Improvements

We have adjusted our Fee Estimations to be more reactive towards the congestion scenario's - what that means is that is that without affecting the regular transaction volume scenario, in case of transaction congestions, our Fee Estimations will have a higher likelihood of getting your transaction through.

### March 01 2024 - Sunset of Goerli Network

As Goerli (Testnet Ethereum Network) has reached its end of life support, we have have removed teh support for Goerli from all our Core Products Like RPC, Data Solution & more, from both API's & SDK.&#x20;



### Jan 15 2024 - Dashboard - Enhanced Notifications

We've revamped the Notifications UI for a smoother experience. We've merged the tables into one comprehensive, filterable, and searchable table. Users can now search for specific notifications using _transaction id_ or _address_. See more on [Notifications page](https://dashboard.tatum.io/notifications).

```typescript
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumio/tatum'
