# get_code

### Overview

The `get_code` method returns an object containing the smart contract WASM code for a specified account on the EOS blockchain. This method is paramount for developers who are looking to analyze or understand the WASM code of deployed smart contracts, enabling an in-depth interaction and integration with the smart contracts.

```typescript
Copy code
// yarn add @tatumio/tatum

import { TatumSDK, Eos, Network } from '@tatumio/tatum'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Eos>({ network: Network.EOS })

const response = await tatum.rpc.getCode({
  accountName: "eosio.token",
  codeAsWasm: 1
})

tatum.destroy() // Destroy Tatum SDK - needed for stopping background jobs
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Example use cases:

1. **Smart Contract Analysis:**
   Developers use this method to retrieve and analyze the WASM code of smart contracts, allowing for comprehensive understanding and debugging of the contract logic.

2. **WASM Code Inspection:**
   This method is vital for users and developers wishing to inspect the WASM code, ensuring the contract's integrity, functionality, and security.

3. **Enhanced Integration and Interaction:**
   Retrieving the WASM code facilitates seamless integration and interaction with smart contracts, ensuring proper deployment, execution, and management of contracts on the EOS blockchain.

### Request Parameters

The `get_code` method requires the following parameters in the request body:

* `accountName` (string, required): The name of the account whose smart contract WASM code needs to be retrieved. Acceptable types are NamePrivileged, NameBasic, NameBid, and NameCatchAll.
* `codeAsWasm` (integer, required): This must be 1 (true).

### Return Object 

The `get_code` method returns an object containing:

* `name` (string): The name of the account from which the WASM code was retrieved. Acceptable types are NamePrivileged, NameBasic, NameBid, and NameCatchAll.
* `code_hash` (string): A Sha256 hash representing the WASM code of the retrieved smart contract.
* `wast` (string): The WebAssembly text format representation of the smart contract.
* `wasm` (string): The WebAssembly binary representation of the smart contract.
* `abi` (object): The ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the smart contract, representing the binary representation of the contract's interface.
