This method can be useful for monitoring the health of the Flare network and analyzing the behavior of the miners. It can also be used to estimate the time it will take for a transaction to be processed, as well as to determine the gas price necessary to ensure prompt inclusion of a transaction in the next block.

### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

### Return Object

The `txpool_status` method returns an object with the following fields:

* **`pending`**: Number of pending transactions in the pool
* **`queued`**: Number of queued transactions in the pool
