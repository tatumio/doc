```typescript
// yarn add @tatumio/tatum

import { TatumSDK, Eos, Network} from '@tatumio/tatum'
  
const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Eos>({ network: Network.EOS })

const rawAbi = await tatum.rpc.getRawAbi({ accountName: 'b1' })

tatum.destroy() // Destroy Tatum SDK - needed for stopping background jobs

### Example use cases:

1. **Smart Contract Interaction:**
Developers or users may use the `get_raw_abi` method to obtain the raw ABI of a smart contract, essential for decoding binary data and enabling effective interaction with the contract.
2. **ABI Analysis and Verification:**
The method allows developers and analysts to study and analyze the ABI of a contract, verify its integrity, and understand its structure and methods by comparing the retrieved `abi_hash` with known hash values.
3. **Development and Debugging:**
This method is crucial for developers during the development and debugging phases, enabling quick access to and assessment of the ABI, ensuring alignment with the contractâ€™s intended design and functionality.

### Request Parameters
The `getRawAbi` method has one parameter:

- `accountName` (string, required): The unique EOSIO account name of the smart contract whose ABI is to be retrieved.

### Return Object
The `get_raw_abi` method returns an object with the following parameters:

- `account_name` (string, required): The name of the account whose ABI was retrieved.
- `code_hash` (string, required): The hash of the smart contract code.
- `abi_hash` (string, required): The hash of the ABI of the smart contract.
- `abi` (string, required): The raw, serialized ABI data.
