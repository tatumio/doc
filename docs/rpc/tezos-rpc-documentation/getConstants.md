# getConstants

### How to use it

\```typescript
// Import required libraries and modules from Tatum SDK
import { TatumSDK, Tezos, Network } from '@tatumio/tatum';

// Initialize the Tatum SDK for Tezos
const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Tezos>({ network: Network.TEZOS });

// Fetch the constants from the Tezos blockchain
const constants = await tatum.rpc.getConstants();

// Log the constants
console.log('Tezos Constants:', constants);

// Always destroy the Tatum SDK instance when done to stop any background processes
await tatum.destroy();
\```

### Overview

The `getConstants` method allows you to retrieve all the constants from the Tezos blockchain. These constants include various operational parameters like proof of work nonce size, max operation data length, and others that are crucial for understanding the blockchain's current configuration.

### Example use cases:

1. **Blockchain Configuration Analysis:**
   Developers and researchers can use this method to obtain detailed information about the Tezos blockchain's current configuration, aiding in development and analysis.

2. **Smart Contract Development:**
   Smart contract developers can use these constants to better understand the operational parameters of the Tezos blockchain, ensuring their contracts are optimized for the current environment.

3. **Operational Monitoring:**
   This method can be used for monitoring the blockchain's parameters, which can be crucial for applications that depend on these constants for their operation.

### Request Parameters

The `getConstants` method does not require any parameters.

### Return Object

The `getConstants` method returns an object containing various constants from the Tezos blockchain. These constants include, but are not limited to:

- `proof_of_work_nonce_size` (integer): The size of the nonce used in proof of work.
- `max_operation_data_length` (integer): Maximum length of operation data.
- `blocks_per_cycle` (integer): The number of blocks per cycle.
- `hard_gas_limit_per_operation` (bignum): The hard gas limit for each operation.

(Note: The actual return object will contain a comprehensive list of all Tezos constants, and the fields might vary based on the blockchain's implementation and version.)
