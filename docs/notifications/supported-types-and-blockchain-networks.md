# Supported types and blockchain networks

### Types of notifications you can monitor

Tatum supports various types of notifications on a chain, which are designed to cover a wide range of blockchain events. These are the notifications types we offer :

<details>

<summary>Incoming Transaction Notifications üì≠ : </summary>

1. [**Incoming Native Transactions**](notification-types/incoming-native-transactions.md)**:** This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, receives some [Native Token](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-is-a-token-on-blockchain/what-are-native-tokens.md) from any address.
2. [**Incoming Internal Transactions**](notification-types/incoming-internal-transactions.md)**:** This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, receives an [Internal transaction](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-are-transactions/what-are-internal-transactions.md) (such as transfer an asset by a smart contract).
3. [**Incoming Fungible Transactions**](notification-types/incoming-tokens.md)**:** This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, receives a [Fungible token](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-is-a-token-on-blockchain/what-are-fungible-tokens.md) from any address.
4. [**Incoming NFT Transactions**](notification-types/incoming-nfts.md): This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, receives a [Non Fungible Token](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-is-a-token-on-blockchain/what-are-non-fungible-tokens.md) (NFT's) from any address.
5. [**Incoming MultiToken Transactions**](notification-types/incoming-multitokens.md): This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, receives [MultiToken](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-is-a-token-on-blockchain/what-are-multitokens.md) from any address.

<summary>Outgoing Transaction Notifications ‚úàÔ∏è : </summary>

1. [**Outgoing Native Transactions**](notification-types/outgoing-native-transactions.md): This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, sends some [Native Token](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-is-a-token-on-blockchain/what-are-native-tokens.md) to any address.
2. [**Outgoing Internal Transactions**](notification-types/outgoing-internal-transactions.md): This notification is triggered when an smart contract address you are subscribed to, sends assets to another address ([Internal transaction](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-are-transactions/what-are-internal-transactions.md)).
3. [**Outgoing Fungible Transactions**](notification-types/outgoing-nfts.md): This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, send's [Fungible tokens](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-is-a-token-on-blockchain/what-are-fungible-tokens.md) to any address.
4. [**Outgoing NFT Transactions**](notification-types/outgoing-nfts.md): This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, sends a [Non Fungible Token](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-is-a-token-on-blockchain/what-are-non-fungible-tokens.md) (NFT's) to any address.
5. [**Outgoing MultiToken Transaction**](notification-types/outgoing-multitokens.md): This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, sends a [MultiToken](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-is-a-token-on-blockchain/what-are-multitokens.md) to any address.
6. [**Outgoing Failed Transactions**](notification-types/outgoing-failed-transactions.md): This notification is triggered when an address you are subscribed to, initiates any transaction but it failed due to any [reason](../../learn-blockchain/basics/what-are-transactions/what-are-the-reasons-a-transaction-fails.md).

3. [**Failed Transactions in a Block** ](notification-types/failed-transactions-in-a-block.md): This notification is triggered when a block containing failed transactions is detected. This notification can be useful for monitoring and analysing failed transactions within specific blocks.
4. [**Contract Address Log Event :**](notification-types/contract-address-log-event.md) This notification allows you to monitor specific custom log events of a smart contract.
