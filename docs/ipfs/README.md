# ðŸ’¿ IPFS

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed and peer-to-peer system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. The IPFS submodule is designed to provide an intuitive interface for users and developers to interact with IPFS, enabling seamless storage of data on this decentralised platform.

Utilising the IPFS submodule, developers can easily integrate decentralised file storage into their applications, ensuring data integrity, permanence, and censorship resistance. By tapping into the global IPFS network, data becomes universally accessible, resistant to single points of failure, and is anchored to the decentralized web.

**Note**: Always be mindful of the data you store on IPFS. Once published, it becomes permanent and may be retrievable by anyone.

**Use Cases**

1. **Decentralised Web Hosting**: Host websites or web applications on IPFS, ensuring they are censorship resistant and always accessible, even if a single node or server goes down.
2. **Data Backup and Archiving**: Store crucial data or archives in a decentralised manner, safeguarding against data loss from centralised server failures or attacks.
3. **Content Distribution**: Use IPFS for content delivery, reducing the load on original servers and ensuring faster data retrieval from the nearest node.
4. **Decentralised Applications (DApps)**: Integrate IPFS storage into DApps to ensure data permanence and resilience against central points of failure.

**Key Features**

* **Data Storage**: Keep your important files persistently stored on IPFS by uploading them, ensuring they remain accessible.

As the decentralised web grows, the IPFS submodule becomes an indispensable tool for developers and users who wish to leverage the power of decentralised file storage and access.
