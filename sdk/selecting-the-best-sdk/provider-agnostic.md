# Provider Agnostic

**What is Provider Agnosticism?**

Provider Agnosticism in our Tatum Web3 SDK offers developers a powerful and flexible approach to interact with the blockchain. It allows you to seamlessly connect your decentralised applications to any Remote Procedure Call (RPC) provider of your choice. Just like a versatile JavaScript framework that works across different browsers.

**The Benefits of Provider Agnosticism**

1. **Freedom of Choice:** Even wIth the lowest cost & 99.99% uptime you might have some reasons to use some other provider and we totally get it.
2. **Reduced Dependency:** No longer are you confined to a single provider's ecosystem. Provider Agnosticism ensures your application is less dependent on a particular service, increasing its resilience and adaptability.

**Unlock the Full Potential of Web3 Development**

By embracing Provider Agnosticism in our Web3 SDK, we aim to empower developers like you to take control of your blockchain applications. Break free from the limitations of a single RPC provider and explore the vast landscape of possibilities that await you in the decentralised world.

Join us on this journey of flexibility, freedom, and boundless potential in Web3 development. Together, let's shape a more open and interconnected blockchain ecosystem. Happy coding! ðŸš€
