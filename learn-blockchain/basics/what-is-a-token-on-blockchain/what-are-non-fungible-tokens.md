# What are Non Fungible Tokens?

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a type of 💎 digital asset that are unique and indivisible. Each NFT is one-of-a-kind and holds a specific value. Examples of NFTs include 🎨 digital art, 🎮 collectibles, and in-game items.

Unlike fungible tokens, which are interchangeable with one another, each NFT holds a unique set of attributes and characteristics that set it apart from all other tokens. This uniqueness is what makes NFTs valuable and desirable to collectors and enthusiasts.

NFTs are created through smart contracts and are stored on a blockchain network, which ensures that they are tamper-proof and transparent. This allows for the creation of trustless and decentralised marketplaces for NFTs, where buyers and sellers can transact with each other without the need for intermediaries. 🤝

One of the primary benefits of NFTs is their ability to represent ownership and provenance of digital assets. Since each NFT is unique and indivisible, it can be used to represent ownership of a specific piece of digital art or a rare collectible. This allows creators and collectors to monetise their work and to create new revenue streams. 💰

NFTs can also be used to create new types of decentralised applications (dApps) and games. For example, NFTs can be used to represent in-game items that have real-world value, which allows for the creation of new types of gaming economies and ecosystems. 🎮

Overall, NFTs are a powerful tool for representing ownership and provenance of digital assets, creating new types of decentralised economies and ecosystems, and unlocking new revenue streams for creators and collectors. Whether you are a developer, investor, or enthusiast, understanding the role of NFTs is essential for navigating the complex and rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology. 💻🌱
