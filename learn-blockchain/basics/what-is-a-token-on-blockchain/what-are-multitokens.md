# What are MultiTokens?

Multitokens are a type of 🎁 digital asset that contain multiple other tokens within them. They are designed to provide a way to bundle multiple tokens together into a single asset, making it easier to manage and trade multiple tokens at once.

Multitokens can contain both fungible and non-fungible tokens, as well as other multitokens. This allows for the creation of complex digital assets that represent multiple tokens and assets on a blockchain network. 🌐

One of the primary benefits of multitokens is their ability to provide diversification within a single asset. By bundling multiple tokens together, multitokens can help to reduce risk and increase exposure to different types of assets and tokens.

Multitokens are created through smart contracts and are stored on a blockchain network, which ensures that they are tamper-proof and transparent. This allows for the creation of trustless and decentralised marketplaces for multitokens, where buyers and sellers can transact with each other without the need for intermediaries. 🤝

Multitokens can have a variety of use cases, including:

🔸 Investment: Multitokens can be used to create diversified investment portfolios that span multiple blockchain networks and asset classes.

🔸 Trading: Multitokens can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, providing a way to trade multiple tokens at once and to diversify trading strategies.

🔸 Decentralised finance (DeFi): Multitokens can be used as collateral or liquidity in DeFi protocols, allowing for more efficient and diverse use of assets in the DeFi ecosystem.

Overall, multitokens are a powerful tool for creating diversified digital assets and for navigating the complex and rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology. Whether you are a developer, investor, or enthusiast, understanding the role of multitokens is essential for staying ahead of the curve in the blockchain industry. 💻🌱
