# What is a Token on Blockchain?

Tokens are digital assets that are created and managed on a blockchain network. They can be broadly classified into two types: native tokens and non-native tokens.

[Native tokens](what-are-native-tokens.md) are created when a blockchain network is launched and are integral to the underlying protocol of the blockchain. They are also known as protocol tokens and are used to facilitate transactions on that network. Examples of native tokens include Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB).

Non-native tokens, on the other hand, are created through smart contracts and can be used to represent specific assets or utility on a blockchain network. They can be further classified into fungible, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) & multi tokens.

ðŸ”¸ [Fungible tokens](what-are-fungible-tokens.md): Fungible tokens are identical to each other and are interchangeable. Each token holds the same value and can be exchanged with any other token of the same type. Examples of fungible tokens include stable coins like Tether (USDT) and MakerDAO (DAI), which are pegged to the value of a specific asset or currency.

ðŸ”¸ [Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](what-are-non-fungible-tokens.md): NFTs are unique and indivisible tokens that represent a specific asset or item. Each NFT is one-of-a-kind and holds a specific value. Examples of NFTs include digital art, collectibles, and in-game items.

ðŸ”¸ [Multitokens](what-are-multitokens.md): Multitokens are a type of digital asset that contain multiple other tokens within them. They provide a way to bundle multiple tokens together into a single asset, making it easier to manage and trade multiple tokens at once. Multitokens can contain both fungible and non-fungible tokens, as well as other multitokens, and can have a variety of use cases, including investment, trading, and DeFi.

Tokens can have a variety of use cases on their respective blockchain networks, including:

ðŸ”¸ Representing assets: Tokens can be used to represent a variety of assets, such as real estate, precious metals, or even other cryptocurrencies.

ðŸ”¸ Utility tokens: Some tokens are designed specifically for use within a particular decentralised application or dApp. These tokens are often used to pay for services or to incentivise network participants to contribute to the network.

ðŸ”¸ Governance tokens: Some tokens are used for governance purposes, allowing token holders to vote on important network decisions, such as protocol upgrades and changes.

ðŸ”¸ Security tokens: Security tokens are tokens that are backed by real-world assets, such as stocks or bonds. These tokens are regulated by securities laws and are subject to the same regulations as traditional securities.

One of the primary benefits of tokens is that they allow for the creation of decentralised economies and ecosystems. By creating tokens that represent specific assets or utility on a blockchain network, developers and entrepreneurs can incentivise network participants to contribute to the network and to help grow the ecosystem.

Tokens also provide a way for investors to participate in the growth of blockchain networks and dApps. By investing in tokens, investors can gain exposure to the potential upside of a particular network or project.

Overall, tokens are a powerful tool for building decentralised economies and ecosystems on blockchain networks. Whether you are a developer, investor, or enthusiast, understanding the role of tokens is essential for navigating the complex and rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology. ðŸ’»ðŸŒ±
