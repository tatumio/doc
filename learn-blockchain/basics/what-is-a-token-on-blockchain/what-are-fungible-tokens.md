# What are Fungible Tokens

Fungible tokens are a type of 💰 digital asset that are identical to each other and can be exchanged for one another. Each token holds the same value and can be exchanged with any other token of the same type. Examples of fungible tokens include stable coins like Tether (USDT) and MakerDAO (DAI), which are pegged to the value of a specific asset or currency.

Fungible tokens are designed to be interchangeable, which means that one token can be exchanged for another token of the same type without any loss of value. This makes them ideal for use as a currency or for representing assets that are uniform and interchangeable, such as 💰 gold or 🛢️ oil.

One of the primary benefits of fungible tokens is their divisibility. Fungible tokens can be divided into smaller units, which allows for more granular transactions and enables micro-transactions on a blockchain network. For example, a single Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshi's, which allows for very small transactions to take place on the Bitcoin network. 💸

Fungible tokens also provide a high degree of liquidity, which means that they can be easily bought and sold on 💹 cryptocurrency exchanges. This allows for the creation of markets and trading pairs, which can help to determine the value of a particular fungible token.

Overall, fungible tokens are an important component of the blockchain ecosystem, providing a way to represent and exchange assets in a uniform and standardised way. Whether you are a developer, investor, or enthusiast, understanding the role of fungible tokens is essential for navigating the complex and rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology. 💻🌱
