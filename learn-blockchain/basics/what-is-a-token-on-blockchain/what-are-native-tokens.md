# What are Native Tokens?

Native tokens are a type of digital token that are created and used on a specific blockchain network. These tokens are usually created during the initial launch of a blockchain network and are used to facilitate transactions on that network. They are also known as protocol tokens, since they are integral to the underlying protocol of the blockchain.

One of the most well-known examples of a native token is Ether (ETH), which is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. ETH is used to pay for transaction fees and to incentivise network participants to secure and validate transactions. It can also be used as a currency to purchase goods and services, much like Bitcoin.

Native tokens can have a variety of uses on their respective blockchain networks, including:

ðŸ”¸ Payment for transaction fees: Native tokens are used to pay for transaction fees on the network. This ensures that the network remains secure and that transactions are processed in a timely manner.

ðŸ”¸ Incentivising network participants: Native tokens are often used to incentivize network participants to contribute to the network. For example, miners who validate transactions on the network are rewarded with native tokens.

ðŸ”¸ Governance: Native tokens can also be used for governance purposes, allowing token holders to vote on important network decisions, such as protocol upgrades and changes.

ðŸ”¸ Staking: Some native tokens can be staked, or locked up, in order to secure the network and earn rewards.

It's important to note that not all tokens on a blockchain network are native tokens. In fact, many blockchain networks have multiple types of tokens, each with their own specific use cases. For example, the Ethereum network has ERC-20 tokens, which are used for creating and managing smart contracts.

In conclusion, native tokens are an important part of many blockchain networks, providing the backbone for transactions and incentivising network participants to contribute to the network.
