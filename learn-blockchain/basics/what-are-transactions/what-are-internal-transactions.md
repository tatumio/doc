# What are Internal Transactions

Internal transactions are 💎 another crucial aspect of blockchain technology that play a vital role in facilitating transactions and maintaining the integrity of the network. Internal transactions occur when tokens are transferred between two addresses on the same blockchain network. 🔁

These transactions are different from external transactions, which involve the transfer of tokens between different blockchain networks or to external addresses outside of the network. 🌐

Internal transactions can be initiated by a variety of actors on the network, including individual users, smart contracts, and decentralised applications (dApps). 💻 Smart contracts are particularly important in facilitating internal transactions, as they can execute complex transactions automatically based on pre-determined conditions.

One of the primary benefits of internal transactions is that they are typically faster and cheaper than external transactions, as they do not require the same level of validation and verification as external transactions. This makes them ideal for small transactions and for sending tokens between different wallets or accounts on the same network. 💰

In addition to their speed and efficiency, internal transactions are also transparent and secure. Since all transactions on a blockchain network are publicly visible and recorded on a distributed ledger, internal transactions can be easily traced and audited. This helps to prevent fraud and other forms of malicious activity on the network. 🔒

Overall, internal transactions are a fundamental component of blockchain technology and are critical to the functioning of many blockchain networks. Whether you are a developer, investor, or enthusiast, understanding the role of internal transactions is essential for navigating the complex and rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology. 🚀
